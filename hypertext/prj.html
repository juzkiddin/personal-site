        <h2>Pepper Plant Ripeness and Disease Detection System (Amrita)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A system that incorporates AI and drone technology to monitor a
            Pepper Plant farm 24x7 to detect the ripeness to plan for harvesting
            and also detect if any disease is present in the plant to take
            necessary precautions against it for the overall wellbeing of the
            farm
          </li>
          <li>
            The system uses the YOLO Object Detection algorithm to detect the
            ripeness of the peppercorn in the pepper plant and also if any
            diseases are present in it.
          </li>
          <li>
            We utilise a drone system based on the KK2.5 flight controller
            mounted with an ESP32 IP cam to obtain the visual data from the
            field
          </li>
          <li>
            On the user side, there is a mobile application developed using
            Flutter through which the farmer can see real-time data about his
            farm
          </li>
          <li>
            In the project, I had the role of Project Lead where I managed and
            tasked the team with working on various technologies necessary for
            the completion of the project and also worked on the Backend of the
            system
          </li>

        <h2>
          Arduino Based Trouble Detection and Caution System for Well Cleaners
          (ICOEI - IEEE)
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designed the circuit, firmware and server program for a Health
            Monitoring system for Well Cleaners
          </li>
          <li>
            The system is split into two parts a transmitter and a receiver and
            uses LoRa for Wireless Communication
          </li>
          <li>
            The transmitter is based on the ATmega328p microcontroller and uses
            a MAX30100 sensor for SPO2 and Pulse. MQ-9 sensor for poisonous gas
            detection. BMP280 sensor for atmospheric pressure and temperature
            detection. It uses the Ra-02 Lora Module for Wireless transmission
          </li>
          <li>
            The receiver is based on the ESP8266 microcontroller that has
            inbuilt WiFi capacity and higher clock speed and memory size
            compared to the ATmega328p. It uses the Ra-02 Lora Module for
            receiving data from the transmitter and passing the data to a local
            server by acting as a web server
          </li>
          <li>
            The local server fetches the data from ESP8266 via HTTP protocol and
            passes the data to a python program that uses the Firebase API to
            update these data to the Google Firebase Database
          </li>
          <li>
            This data is then fetched from the database and shown to the user
            via a Mobile Application
          </li>
          <li>
            I had the role of Circuit Designer and also designed the firmware
            for both the Microcontrollers. I also developed the software that
            needed to run on the local server for the backend data updation to
            the Cloud database
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Automatic Hand Sanitiser Dispenser</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designed the circuitry and body for an Automatic Sanitizer Dispenser
            Machine that features a no contact ultrasonic sensor-based dispenser
            system
          </li>
          <li>
            It was built around the ATmega-8 AVR microcontroller that is clocked
            at 16Mhz and provides fast and responsive dispensing of sanitiser at
            a rate of 2ml every 2 seconds
          </li>
          <li>
            The ultrasonic sensor used is HC-SR04 and the machine had a total
            capacity of 2Litres. It works on a 12V DC input and has a standby
            current draw of 38-50mA and a peak current draw of 480-590mA during
            pump activation
          </li>
          <li>
            In the project I had the role of Project Lead where I managed and
            tasked my team and also worked in creating and testing the circuit
            necessary to drive the machine
